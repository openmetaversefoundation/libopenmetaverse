	/// that describes the subband decomposition for a wavelet transform. This
	/// class is implemented by the SubbandAn and SubbandSyn classes, which are for
	/// the analysis and synthesis sides respectively.
	/// 
	/// <p>The element can be either a node or a leaf of the tree. If it is a node,
	/// it has 4 descendants (LL, HL, LH and HH). If it is a leaf, it has no
