	/// <summary> This is the abstract class for writing to a codestream. A codestream
	/// corresponds to headers (main and tile-parts) and packets. Each packet has a
	/// head and a body. The codestream always has a maximum number of bytes that
	/// can be written to it. After that many number of bytes no more data is
	/// written to the codestream but the number of bytes is counted so that the
	/// value returned by getMaxAvailableBytes() is negative. If the number of
	/// bytes is unlimited a ridicoulosly large value, such as Integer.MAX_VALUE,
	/// is equivalent.
	/// 
	/// <p>Data writting to the codestream can be simulated. In this case, no byto
	/// is effectively written to the codestream but the resulting number of bytes
	/// is calculated and returned (although it is not accounted in the bit
	/// stream). This can be used in rate control loops.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Implementing classes should write the header of the bit stream before
	/// writing any packets. The bit stream header can be written with the help of
	/// the HeaderEncoder class.</p>
