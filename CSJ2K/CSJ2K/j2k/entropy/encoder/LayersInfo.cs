	/// <summary> This class stores the specification of a layer distribution in the bit
	/// stream. The specification is made of optimization points and a number of
	/// extra layers to add between the optimization points. Each optimization
	/// point creates a layer which is optimized by the rate allocator to the
	/// specified target bitrate. The extra layers are added by the rate allocator
	/// between the optimized layers, with the difference that they are not
	/// optimized (i.e. they have no precise target bitrate).
	/// 
	/// <p>The overall target bitrate for the bit stream is always added as the
	/// last optimization point without any extra layers after it. If there are
	/// some optimization points whose target bitrate is larger than the overall
	/// target bitrate, the overall target bitrate will still appear as the last
	/// optimization point, even though it does not follow the increasing target
	/// bitrate order of the other optimization points. The rate allocator is
	/// responsible for eliminating layers that have target bitrates larger than
	/// the overall target bitrate.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Optimization points can be added with the addOptPoint() method. It takes
	/// the target bitrate for the optimized layer and the number of extra layers
	/// to add after it.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Information about the total number of layers, total number of
	/// optimization points, target bitrates, etc. can be obtained with the other
	/// methods.</p>
