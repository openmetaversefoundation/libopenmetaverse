	/// <summary> This class implements the JPEG 2000 entropy coder, which codes stripes in
	/// code-blocks. This entropy coding engine can function in a single-threaded
	/// mode where one code-block is encoded at a time, or in a multi-threaded mode
	/// where multiple code-blocks are entropy coded in parallel. The interface
	/// presented by this class is the same in both modes.
	/// 
	/// <p>The number of threads used by this entropy coder is specified by the
	/// "jj2000.j2k.entropy.encoder.StdEntropyCoder.nthreads" Java system
	/// property. If set to "0" the single threaded implementation is used. If set
	/// to 'n' ('n' larger than 0) then 'n' extra threads are started by this class
	/// which are used to encode the code-blocks in parallel (i.e. ideally 'n'
	/// code-blocks will be encoded in parallel at a time). On multiprocessor
	/// machines under a "native threads" Java Virtual Machine implementation each
	/// one of these threads can run on a separate processor speeding up the
	/// encoding time. By default the single-threaded implementation is used. The
	/// multi-threaded implementation currently assumes that the vast majority of
	/// consecutive calls to 'getNextCodeBlock()' will be done on the same
	/// component. If this is not the case, the speed-up that can be expected on
	/// multiprocessor machines might be significantly decreased.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>The code-blocks are rectangular, with dimensions which must be powers of
	/// 2. Each dimension has to be no smaller than 4 and no larger than 256. The
	/// product of the two dimensions (i.e. area of the code-block) may not exceed
	/// 4096.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Context 0 of the MQ-coder is used as the uniform one (uniform,
	/// non-adaptive probability distribution). Context 1 is used for RLC
	/// coding. Contexts 2-10 are used for zero-coding (ZC), contexts 11-15 are
	/// used for sign-coding (SC) and contexts 16-18 are used for
	/// magnitude-refinement (MR).</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>This implementation buffers the symbols and calls the MQ coder only once
	/// per stripe and per coding pass, to reduce the method call overhead.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>This implementation also provides some timing features. They can be
	/// enabled by setting the 'DO_TIMING' constant of this class to true and
	/// recompiling. The timing uses the 'System.currentTimeMillis()' Java API
	/// call, which returns wall clock time, not the actual CPU time used. The
	/// timing results will be printed on the message output. Since the times
	/// reported are wall clock times and not CPU usage times they can not be added
	/// to find the total used time (i.e. some time might be counted in several
	/// places). When timing is disabled ('DO_TIMING' is false) there is no penalty
	/// if the compiler performs some basic optimizations. Even if not the penalty
	/// should be negligeable.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>The source module must implement the CBlkQuantDataSrcEnc interface and
	/// code-block's data is received in a CBlkWTData instance. This modules sends
	/// code-block's information in a CBlkRateDistStats instance.</p>
