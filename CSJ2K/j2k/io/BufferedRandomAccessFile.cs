	/// <summary> This class defines a Buffered Random Access File.  It implements the
	/// <tt>BinaryDataInput</tt> and <tt>BinaryDataOutput</tt> interfaces so that
	/// binary data input/output can be performed. This class is abstract since no
	/// assumption is done about the byte ordering type (little Endian, big
	/// Endian). So subclasses will have to implement methods like
	/// <tt>readShort()</tt>, <tt>writeShort()</tt>, <tt>readFloat()</tt>, ...
	/// 
	/// <P><tt>BufferedRandomAccessFile</tt> (BRAF for short) is a
	/// <tt>RandomAccessFile</tt> containing an extra buffer. When the BRAF is
	/// accessed, it checks if the requested part of the file is in the buffer or
	/// not. If that is the case, the read/write is done on the buffer. If not, the
	/// file is uppdated to reflect the current status of the buffer and the file
	/// is then accessed for a new buffer containing the requested byte/bit.
