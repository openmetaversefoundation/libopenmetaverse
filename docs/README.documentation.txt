The library documentation is generated using external tools which currently create:

* A HTML Website http://www.libsecondlife.org/docs/trunk
* A compiled HTML Help file http://www.libsecondlife.org/docs/trunk/OpenMetaverse.chm

These are generated by our automated build system nightly using the inline XML code documentation.

If you want to generate these documents locally you will need to do the following:

1) Download and install the following tools:
   Sandcastle: http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle
   Sandcastle Help File Builder: http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB (You will need version 1.7.0.0 or newer)
   Microsoft HTML Help: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=14188

2) Set the following Environment variables to match your installation:
   SANDCASTLE=<path to SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe> 
   e.g.: "SANDCASTLE=C:\Program Files\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe"

   Modify your path statement to include the Sandcastle Help File Builder installation directory
   e.g: "C:\Program Files\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\"

   If you set these in control panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables you will either need to 
   restart your computer, or close and restart visual studio for those changes to be go into effect.

3) We use prebuild to configure and build this project, see the readme.txt in the projects root directory for 
   more information. To build with docs: from the project root directory run: "runprebuild.bat msbuild docs" followed
   by compile.bat, this will generate the necessary xml documentation and assemblies, then create the html project documentation


Additionally if you have 7-Zip installed in the path, a zip archive will be created in the documentation tree
containing all the documentation in a compressed format see: http://www.7-zip.org/
