[Extensions]

;
; ---Server Extensions---
;

; A local account store
AccountManager

; A local asset store using the filesystem to store assets
AssetManager

; Creates an account for anyone who logs in. The account will be registered 
; with the account provider so persistence between sessions is possible, but
; no form of authentication or authorization is done
AuthFreeForAll

; Manages creation and deletion of capabilities (see 
; http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Capabilities for more information).
CapsManager

; A local grid service provider
GridLocal

; A local inventory store
InventoryManager

; Implements the login server for Linden-based clients directly into Simian
LindenLogin

; A simulator-local messaging layer for instant messages and script e-mails
MessagingLocal

; A permissions module that grants full access for everything. Only use this if
; all of the system users are fully trusted
PermissionsFreeForAll

; Converts prims into 3D geometry data. This is only used if a physics engine
; is present that makes use of prim mesh data.
RenderingPluginMesher

; Main scene graph engine. All spatial events are processed through here.
SceneManager

; Allows other extensions to persist data using OSD serialization

AvatarManager

; Track parcels and parcel information for a scene
ParcelManager

; A simple physics engine with accurate implementations of the interfaces and 
; reasonable avatar-only physics with no external dependencies. Good performance
; for lightweight scenes, but scales poorly in complex scenes.
PhysicsSimple

; Physics engine provided by the Open Dynamics Engine library. Work in progress,
; not functional yet.
;PhysicsODE

; Allows LSL functions to be called through chat
ScriptConsole

; Periscope allows you to proxy a foreign grid simulator into the local Simian
; using a libOpenMetaverse bot. The first person to login to Simian will become 
; the master agent, who's movement is tethered to the bot's movement. Any other 
; agents that login can move around freely, but will only see what the master 
; agent is seeing through the periscope. If you enable this extension, disable 
; LLAssets, LLMovement, and LLTextures as Periscope has its own implementations 
; of those extensions
