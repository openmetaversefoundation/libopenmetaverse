; Handles sending and receiving packets in the LLUDP format
UDPManager

; LLUDP connection management. Allows agents to connect and disconnect from a
; simulator, as well as keeping the UDP connection alive.
ConnectionManagement

; Creates an account for anyone who logs in. The account will be registered 
; with the account provider so persistence between sessions is possible, but
; no form of authentication or authorization is done
AuthFreeForAll

; A permissions module that grants full access for everything. Only use this if
; all of the system users are fully trusted
PermissionsFreeForAll

; Implements the login server for Linden-based clients directly into Simian
LindenLogin

;
; ---Local Simulator Extensions---
;
; The following extensions may use persistence, but do not communicate with a
; remote server or other simulators. These extensions are only useful for a
; single simulator running in standalone mode, and will have unexpected results
; if the simulator is part of a larger grid.

; A simulator-local account store
AccountManager

; A simulator-local asset store using the filesystem to store assets
AssetManager

; A simulator-local inventory store
InventoryManager

; A simulator-local task inventory store
TaskInventoryManager

; A simulator-local messaging layer for instant messages and script e-mails
MessagingLocal

; A world map that shows the local region and a single HyperGrid link
MapLocal

;
; ---End Local Simulator Extensions---
;

; Manages creation and deletion of capabilities (see 
; http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Capabilities for more information).
CapsManager

; Various avatar-related functions including appearance, animations and sounds
AvatarManager

; Friendship management and alerts
FriendManager

; Chat and instant messaging
Messaging

; Money management and accounting functions
Money

; Texture downloads
ImageDelivery

; Other asset downloads
TransferManager

; A simple physics engine for avatar movement. Supports walking, flying, and
; swimming as well as avatar-avatar collisions. Does not support avatar-prim
; or prim-prim collisions.
Movement

; Object creation, editing, deleting, etc. Processes packets and passes events
; to the scene provider.
ObjectManager

; Parcel management
ParcelManager

; Converts prims into 3D geometry data. This is only used if a physics engine
; is present that makes use of prim mesh data.
RenderingPluginMesher

; Main scene graph engine. All spatial events are processed through here.
SceneManager

; An scripting engine implementation adapted from OpenSim
XScriptEngine

; Allows LSL functions to be called through chat
ScriptConsole

; Periscope allows you to proxy a foreign grid simulator into the local Simian
; using a libOpenMetaverse bot. The first person to login to Simian will become 
; the master agent, who's movement is tethered to the bot's movement. Any other 
; agents that login can move around freely, but will only see what the master 
; agent is seeing through the periscope. If you enable this extension, disable 
; ImageDelivery and Movement as Periscope has its own implementations of those 
; extensions
;Periscope

;
; ---Persistence Providers---
;
; The following extensions allow extensions that use persistence to save
; state between simulator runs. Only one persistence provider should be
; active.

; Persistence provider using LLSD XML serialization
XMLPersistence
